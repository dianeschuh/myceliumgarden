## Mycelium Garden - sound installation project in co-composition with a mycelium network – 
winner of the EUR ArTec Symbiosis call for projects


This project, developed as part of EUR ArTec's 'Symbiose' call for research projects, focuses on the interaction between humans and a mycelium network. It seeks to understand and use the electrical expressions of the mycelium from a musical perspective. The methodology is based on a search for 'objective knowledge' (Popper, 1985), studying interactions with the mycelium through an experimental process. The project explores the creation of assemblages to make this interaction sensitive and audible. It questions interfaces and transductions in interspecific interactions, highlighting the importance of recognising the otherness of non-human beings. The installation underlines the need to develop research protocols guided by a principle of 'verisimilitude' in the context of an ecological project of attention to living things. 

### phase 1
In the first phase of the project (release “MyceliumGarden_phase1”) we developed a sound installation using a combination of 2d Ambisonics and WFS for immersion.

You should download the Holophonix Designer software to have the correct placements of the sound sources

### phase 2
In this second phase of the installation, an A.I. agent has been developed to generate video in real time. The sound system was designed in 3d ambisonics to co-compose an immersive and enveloping sound environment.

For this phase there is the possibility to add a image projection co-composed between the mycelium signal and an AI agent (code is in the same folder, follow the instruction written in the patch)

The two releases include, in the Max patches, simulation of the mycelium signal and stereo mixdown to be able to listen. You should adjust the decoder depending on your audio setup.
If connected to a mycelium organism you need a signal acquisition device. We use two EAVI boards from the ANR project BBDMI and adapted the patch code to the system. See https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/bbdmi/bbdmi
